Hi!                                                                                                                                                                               
This is the programmer of calculator-py.                                                                                                                                          
calculator-py is a very simple code, and everyone can change it (add more numbers, add their own ideas).                                                                          
I made calculator-py to make it easy for everyone to use a calculator in Python.                                                                                                  
Have fun!
